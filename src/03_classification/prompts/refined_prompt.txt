As part of an academic research project that involves the study of transmembrane proteins and their role in the transduction of fluid shear stress to nitric oxide production in endothelial cells. The nature of my study necessitates the usage of relevant literature, because we will be training a skip gram model from this corpus of data. I would like you to help me in this selection process by classifying the given abstract. Each abstract should be considered in terms of its potential value to the model's training set, as we are applying a skip-gram model. The criteria for relevance include: Relating to the field of transmembrane proteins or Relating to the transduction of fluid shear stress or Relating to nitric oxide production in endothelial cells. Respond only with RELEVANT OR NOT RELEVANT. I do not want any explanation/justification of any sort in your answer. Abstract: '{abstract}'.
